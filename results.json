The Aeroplan program</strong> <br /> <br />The Aeroplan program (\"<strong>Aeroplan Program</strong>\") is the loyalty rewards and recognition program operated by Air Canada's subsidiary Aeroplan Inc. (\"<strong>Aeroplan</strong>\", \"<strong>we</strong>\",\r\n        \"<strong>us</strong>\", \"<strong>our</strong>\"). The Aeroplan Program allows individuals, or their parent or legal guardian in the case of a minor, to enroll as members (\"<strong>Member</strong>\", \"<strong>you</strong>\", \"<strong>your</strong>\",\r\n        \"<strong>their</strong>\") and to open an Aeroplan account (\"<strong>Account</strong>\"), to accumulate Aeroplan points (\"<strong>Aeroplan Points</strong>\") through the purchase of products and services from participating partners and suppliers\r\n        and to redeem Aeroplan Points for a variety of travel, merchandise, gift card, and other rewards provided directly by participating partners or made available through Aeroplan's intermediary suppliers, all in accordance with these terms and conditions\r\n        (\"<strong>Terms and Conditions</strong>\"). <br /> <br /> These Terms and Conditions replace any other terms and conditions that we may have provided to you and govern your participation as a Member in the Aeroplan Program. By participating in\r\n        the Aeroplan Program, you (or your parent or legal guardian on your behalf, as the case may be), accept and agree to these Terms and Conditions, including as they may be amended from time to time.<br><br></li>\r\n    <li><strong>2. Enrollment in the Aeroplan program</strong><br /> <br /> Membership in the Aeroplan Program (\"<strong>Aeroplan Membership</strong>\") is free and limited to natural persons. Except as may be authorized by us, at our sole discretion, Aeroplan\r\n        Membership is not available to corporations, trusts, partnerships or other entities.<br /> <br /> You can only enroll in the Aeroplan Program once, individually, using your full legal name exactly as it appears on your passport or if you don't\r\n        have a passport, on a government-issued identification. <br /> <br /> Minors, being children under the age of majority in their respective province, territory or jurisdiction of residence, can only be enrolled in the Aeroplan Program by their\r\n        parent or legal guardian. By enrolling a minor in the Aeroplan Program, you confirm that: (i) you are the minor's parent or legal guardian; and (ii) you, and not the minor, are providing the minor's information to Aeroplan. You must enroll a minor\r\n        by using a unique valid email address that is owned and maintained by you, and not associated with another Account.<br><br></li>\r\n    <li><strong>3. Online access to your Aeroplan membership information and account</strong><br /> <br /> Aeroplan Memberships and Accounts are administered online only. You are required to have a valid email address.

Our communications with you</strong> <br /> <br /> Our form of communication with you about your Account will be by email. By participating in the Aeroplan Program, you agree that all Aeroplan Program, Aeroplan Membership and Account communications\r\n        may be provided to you electronically and, unless we choose otherwise, electronically only.<br /> <br /> From time to time, you may receive personalized or exclusive marketing offers extended to certain segments of Members. You can withdraw consent\r\n        to receive such offers at any time by updating your profile <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.aircanada.com/myaeroplanprofile\">here</a>, by clicking the \"unsubscribe\" link in any marketing email, by replying \"STOP\" in marketing SMS text messages, or by contacting\r\n        the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.aircanada.com/ca/en/aco/home/fly/customer-support.html\">Aeroplan Contact Centre</a>.<br><br></li>\r\n    <li><strong>5. Keeping your Aeroplan membership information secure and up-to-date</strong><br /> <br /> You are responsible for protecting and keeping your Aeroplan Membership and Account information secure, including online credentials, passwords, PINs\r\n        and your physical Aeroplan Membership card. You must take care to prevent misuse by ensuring that no unauthorized third party has access to your Aeroplan Membership and Account information. In cases of suspected wrongful access or misuse of your\r\n        Aeroplan Membership or Account information, you must notify us immediately by contacting the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.aircanada.com/ca/en/aco/home/fly/customer-support.html\">Aeroplan Contact Centre</a>.<br /> <br /> For security and privacy reasons and unless otherwise\r\n        authorized or required by law, Aeroplan Membership and Account information will only be communicated to the individual Member, a parent or guardian of record in the case of a minor, or a person authorized by the Member to access a Member's Aeroplan\r\n        Membership and Account information. <br /> <br /> You are also responsible for updating your Aeroplan Membership information including any change to your legal name, email address, telephone number, residential address, province, territory or\r\n        jurisdiction of residence. We will be entitled to rely upon the province, territory or jurisdiction of your residence until you update such information with us. Updates to your Aeroplan Membership information can be made online by accessing your\r\n        Account or by calling the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.aircanada.com/ca/en/aco/home/fly/customer-support.html#contact-aeroplan\">Aeroplan Contact Centre</a>. We may request that you confirm or update your personal information or validate its accuracy at any time, and you\r\n        are responsible for responding to our request. We are not responsible if we cannot contact you because you have not given us current or accurate information or responded to a validation request. Aeroplan may always rely on the accuracy of the\r\n        Aeroplan Membership information provided in your Account until otherwise advised by you through an Account Membership information update.<br><br></li>\r\n    <li><strong>6. Accumulation and Redemption of Aeroplan Points</strong><br><br>In order to accumulate or redeem Aeroplan Points, you must be a Member in good standing, meaning you are fully in compliance with these Terms and Conditions and, where applicable,\r\n        any additional terms and conditions of Aeroplan and its participating partners and suppliers (\u201cGood Standing\u201d). Aeroplan Points are accumulated through the purchase of products and services from participating partners and suppliers and through\r\n        purchase transactions using an Aeroplan credit card. Aeroplan Points may also be accumulated through time-limited promotional offers from Aeroplan or participating partners and suppliers. Subject to the policy of any participating Aeroplan partner,\r\n        Aeroplan Points may only be accumulated by the Member who transacts with an Aeroplan partner for which Aeroplan Points are earned and the Aeroplan Points associated with such transaction will only be credited to the Account of that Member. In\r\n        the case of air transportation services, Aeroplan Points may only be accumulated by the Member who is the individual traveler whose name and Aeroplan Membership number appear on the ticket for air transportation services and such Aeroplan Points\r\n        will only be credited to the Account of that Member. In the case of an Aeroplan credit card, Aeroplan Points will only be credited to the Account of the Member who is the primary card holder of that Aeroplan credit card Aeroplan Points will not\r\n        be credited to the membership number or Account of any other Member. Aeroplan may, on such terms, conditions, and limitations as it may, in its sole discretion, establish from time to time, permit loyalty rewards earned under a rewards program\r\n        offered by a third-party (a \u201cConversion Program\u201d) to be converted into Aeroplan Points. The account of the Member with such Conversion Program must be in the Member\u2019s name so that the name on the Account with Aeroplan and the account under such\r\n        Conversion Program are the same person. Under the Aeroplan Program, the intention of permitting conversions from a Conversion Program into Aeroplan Points is so that the resulting Aeroplan Points under any such conversion arrangement are thereafter\r\n        used by the Member for redemptions within the Aeroplan Program and Aeroplan reserves the right, at any time, to impose limitations on the ability of a Member to engage in conversions from a Conversion Program into Aeroplan Points and on the use\r\n        of such Aeroplan Points upon conversion. Unless otherwise permitted by Aeroplan, purchases of products and services from participating partners and suppliers prior to a person\u2019s enrolment in the Aeroplan Program are not eligible for the accumulation\r\n        of Aeroplan Points. Aeroplan Points can be redeemed for a variety of travel, merchandise, gift card, and other rewards offered by Aeroplan\u2019s participating partners and suppliers, all in accordance with these Terms and Conditions and any additional\r\n        terms and conditions that may apply to a specific redemption. The number of Aeroplan Points required to redeem certain rewards such as flights (including those operated by Air Canada) and hotel reservations may be dynamic and subject to change\r\n        depending on inventory availability, time of redemption and a series of other factors that are determined by Aeroplan and its participating partners and suppliers. Participating partners and suppliers and the rewards, merchandise and gift cards\r\n        made available may change at any time without notice.<br><br></li>\r\n    <li><strong>7. Aeroplan Family Sharing</strong><br /> <br /> The following definitions apply to these Terms and Conditions relating to the Aeroplan Family Sharing feature: <br /> <br /> \"<strong>Family Lead</strong>\" means the Member that creates and\r\n        manages the Pool and has the authority to: (i) invite up to 7 other Members to join the Pool; (ii) designate whether each Member joining the Pool is solely a contributor or is a contributor and redeemer; and (iii) remove any existing Member from\r\n        a Pool. <br /> <br /> \"<strong>Family Member</strong>\" means the Family Lead or a Member who joins a Pool and who is designated by the Family Lead, as either a contributor only or as a contributor and redeemer. <br /> <br /> \"<strong>Pool</strong>\"\r\n        means a group of a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 8 Members, each in Good Standing, who have a family relationship and who agree to share their Aeroplan Points into a single Aeroplan Points' balance to collectively accumulate Aeroplan Points and\r\n        facilitate redemption of Aeroplan Points for personal purposes only and not for any business, commercial or other use. <br /> <br /> You must be 18 years or older to be a Family Lead. You can create a Pool and invite family members who are Members\r\n        to join your Pool by logging into your online Account and following the prescribed steps. You can only be part of one Pool at a time. <br /> <br /> When you create or join a Pool, all your current Aeroplan Points are shared with the Aeroplan Points\r\n        of all other Family Members. If you are the Family Lead or are identified by the Family Lead as a contributor and redeemer of Aeroplan Points within the Pool, you may, at your sole discretion, redeem any or all of the Aeroplan Points that are\r\n        shared in the Pool, including Aeroplan Points that were accumulated by other Family Members. Family Members will not be able to redeem points solely from their own Aeroplan Points' balance. If you are identified by the Family Lead as a contributor\r\n        only, you will not be able to redeem any Aeroplan Points shared by the Pool and will only be contributing to the accumulation of Aeroplan Points in that Pool. In joining a Pool, you will be asked to acknowledge and agree to the rules specific\r\n        to the accumulation and redemption of shared Aeroplan Points, including, without limitation, the ability of other Family Members to redeem Aeroplan Points that you have accumulated individually and to view certain of your Aeroplan Membership and\r\n        Account Information. Aeroplan accepts no liability for any losses suffered by a Family Member as a result of another Family Member's actions within a Pool, including another Family Member's redemption of your Aeroplan Points. <br /> <br /> When\r\n        a Family Member redeems Aeroplan Points shared in a Pool, Aeroplan Points are deducted from each Family Member's account prorated to their Aeroplan Points' balance at the time of redemption. Through your online Account, you will be able to view\r\n        the total balance of Aeroplan Points of the Pool and the total balance of each Family Member's balance of Aeroplan Points. <br /> <br /> You can only leave a Pool 3 months after joining or creating it. If you leave a Pool, you will retain the\r\n        Aeroplan Points that remain in your Account at the time you leave. You are free to join or form another Pool only after 6 months of leaving one. If a Family Lead requests to leave a Pool, the Pool will be dissolved and the Family Lead and each\r\n        Family Member will retain the Aeroplan Points that remain in their Account at the time the Pool is dissolved. In the case of death or incapacity of a Family Lead or termination of a Family Lead's Aeroplan Membership for any reason, Aeroplan will\r\n        automatically dissolve the Pool. <br /> <br /> Aeroplan reserves the right to request that you validate your family relationship with other Family Members at any time. If we suspect any untruthful, fraudulent or illicit activity related to a Pool\r\n        in any way, we may, at our sole discretion, temporarily or permanently prohibit any or all Family Members from participating in a Pool or from accumulating or redeeming Aeroplan Points, or we may suspend or terminate the Pool, any or all of the\r\n        associated Aeroplan Memberships and close any or all of the associated Accounts. <br /> <br /> Additional information on Aeroplan Family Sharing can be found <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.aircanada.com/ca/en/aco/home/aeroplan/family-sharing.html#/\">here</a>.<br\r\n        /><br /></li>\r\n    <li><strong>8. Account inactivity</strong><br /> <br /> All Aeroplan Points in an inactive Account are forfeited. Unless otherwise permitted by Aeroplan, in its sole discretion, your Account becomes inactive if you have not accumulated or redeemed Aeroplan\r\n        Points for 18 consecutive months. If an Account is inactive for 5 consecutive years, we reserve the right to terminate your Aeroplan Membership, close your Account and reassign your Aeroplan number.<br /> <br /> If you participate in Aeroplan\r\n        Family Sharing, the redemption of Aeroplan Points by any Family Member will constitute an activity in the Account of each Family Member who has at least 1 Aeroplan Point in their Account thereby preventing Account inactivity.<br><br></li>\r\n    <li><strong>9. Termination of your Aeroplan membership</strong><br /> <br /> You may terminate your Aeroplan Membership and close your Account at any time without cost or penalty. You should redeem all Aeroplan Points in your Account prior to such termination.\r\n        Any Aeroplan Points in your Account at the time you terminate your Aeroplan Membership or close your Account will be immediately forfeited, and you will no longer have any rights as a Member or entitlement to any such Aeroplan Points. <br /> <br\r\n        /> Aeroplan Membership also terminates upon the death or personal bankruptcy of a Member.<br><br></li>\r\n    <li><strong>10. Welcome Bonus Provisions</strong> <br /><br />From time to time, Aeroplan and the financial institutions that issue Aeroplan co-brand credit cards (an \u201cAeroplan Credit Card\u201d), together with their respective affiliates and business partners,\r\n        may offer an incentive or bonus of Aeroplan Points (a \u201cWelcome Bonus\u201d) to incentivize a Member to become a holder of an Aeroplan Credit Card or acquire products or services (\u201cProducts and Services\u201d) offered from time to time as part of the Aeroplan\r\n        Program by such parties. In connection with a Welcome Bonus being made available for becoming a holder of an Aeroplan Credit Card, such Welcome Bonus is intended as an incentive for a Member to become a holder of an Aeroplan Credit Card where\r\n        that Member is not then a holder of the specific type of Aeroplan Credit Card for which the Welcome Bonus is being offered. Similarly, in connection with bonus or incentive Aeroplan Points being offered as an incentive related to Products and\r\n        Services, such bonus Aeroplan Points incentives are intended for a Member who has not previously received bonus Aeroplan Points for the same Products or Services, to acquire such Products or Services. Aeroplan may, in its sole discretion, choose\r\n        to limit the number of Welcome Bonuses or similar bonuses or incentives a Member may receive in any period, and, in addition to the other remedies set forth in these Terms and Conditions, reserves the right to suspend, revoke or terminate the\r\n        Account of any person who engages in a behaviour of excessive use of the Welcome Bonus offers. Such behaviours include but are not limited to: (i) applying for multiple Aeroplan Credit Cards across one or more product types or across one or more\r\n        financial institutions that issue an Aeroplan Credit Card; (ii) a pattern of cancelling, or disengaging in, an Aeroplan Credit Card shortly after receiving a Welcome Bonus or similar bonus or incentive; and (iii) a pattern of purchasing and then\r\n        cancelling or returning any product or service for which Aeroplan Points were issued. 11. Prohibited Activity Aeroplan Membership is a privilege that can be suspended, revoked, or terminated at any time, for any reason, and without compensation.\r\n        Reasons for suspension, revocation or termination include, but are not limited to: (i) a circumstance where a Member intentionally engages in a pattern of activity or behavior that, in the reasonable opinion of Aeroplan, is intended to circumvent\r\n        or work around these Terms and Conditions, or the terms and conditions of any Aeroplan partner; (ii) any abuse by a Member of any of these Terms and Conditions, any additional applicable terms and conditions or any benefit, privilege or reward\r\n        associated with the Aeroplan Program; (iii) any misrepresentation by a Member to Aeroplan, its affiliates, participating partners or suppliers or to any entity associated with or participating in the Aeroplan Program; and (iv) any other actions\r\n        or conduct of a Member deemed by Aeroplan, in its sole discretion, to be damaging to Aeroplan, the Aeroplan Program or the interests of Aeroplan\u2019s affiliates, participating partners or suppliers, including, but not limited to: (i) applying for\r\n        multiple credit cards across different product types (e.g., Entry, Core, Premium), across multiple financial institutions that issue an Aeroplan Credit Card in order to circumnavigate these Terms and Conditions or the terms and conditions of any\r\n        such financial institution issuing an Aeroplan Credit Card thereby receiving multiple Welcome Bonuses; and (ii) a behaviour of cancelling, or disengaging in, an Aeroplan Credit Card shortly after receiving a Welcome Bonus. Where, in the reasonable\r\n        opinion of Aeroplan, a Member has violated these Terms and Conditions, Aeroplan may, at any time and in its sole discretion, take one or more of the following actions: (i) freeze the Account of any Member while Aeroplan investigates suspected\r\n        activity on the part of that Member; and (ii) refuse to credit the Account of any Member, or debit the Account of any Member. In the event a Member\u2019s participation in the Aeroplan Program is terminated by Aeroplan in accordance with these Terms\r\n        and Conditions, all accumulated Aeroplan Points will immediately be forfeited. Aeroplan reserves the right to restrict or refuse Aeroplan Membership in the Aeroplan Program for any reason, in its sole discretion, including, if you do not meet\r\n        the requirements set forth in these Terms and Conditions, if you are suspected of fraud or illicit conduct or have had an Aeroplan Membership previously revoked or terminated by Aeroplan. Unauthorized reproduction of any Aeroplan Membership card\r\n        or number, or fraudulent misrepresentation of an Aeroplan Membership is prohibited and can result in legal action. Aeroplan Membership cards and Membership numbers belong to Aeroplan and may be revoked at any time in its sole discretion.<br /><br\r\n        /></li>\r\n    <li><strong>11. No property or vested rights</strong><br /> <br /> The accumulation of Aeroplan Points does not entitle you to any vested rights and, in accumulating Aeroplan Points, you may not rely upon the continued availability of any reward, benefit\r\n        or privilege, including without limitation any reward price, redemption/reward chart, status privilege or Aeroplan credit card cardholder benefits.<br /> <br /> With the exception of the specific rules relating to Aeroplan Family Sharing, Aeroplan\r\n        Points, and any other benefits, privileges and rewards of the Aeroplan Program are personal to you and cannot be assigned, traded, bartered, willed, exchanged for cash, or otherwise transferred, except as may be authorized by Aeroplan, at its\r\n        sole discretion and in accordance with these Terms and Conditions. Any assignment or transfer in violation of these Terms and Conditions may, at Aeroplan's discretion, result in the termination of your Aeroplan Membership and the cancellation\r\n        of the affected Aeroplan Points, benefits, privileges and rewards, as the case may be. <br /> <br /> Aeroplan Points have no monetary value and cannot under any circumstances form the basis of a monetary claim against Aeroplan, its affiliates\r\n        or any participating partners or suppliers. Aeroplan may, in its sole discretion, allow you, from time to time, to purchase, gift or transfer Aeroplan Points to another Member. Additional information on how you can purchase, gift or transfer Aeroplan\r\n        Points can be found <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://buy.points.com/marketing/aeroplan_kilo/index.html#/en-CA\">here</a>. <br /> <br /> Unless otherwise permitted by Aeroplan, Aeroplan Points cannot be transferred or converted to and from another loyalty\r\n        program currency. You should always consult our website for the most current ability (if any) to transfer or convert Aeroplan Points to and from other loyalty program currencies. For your convenience, additional information on permitted conversions\r\n        can be found <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.aircanada.com/ca/en/aco/home/aeroplan/your-aeroplan/conversion-programs.html\">here</a>.<br><br></li>\r\n    <li><strong>12. Changes to these Terms and Conditions and the Aeroplan Program</strong> <br /><br />Subject to applicable law, Aeroplan reserves the right to unilaterally amend, restrict, suspend, extend or otherwise alter each and every one of these\r\n        Terms and Conditions, each and every additional term and condition of the Aeroplan Program and each and every feature and benefit of the Aeroplan Program at any time, including, but not limited to, the terms, conditions and obligations contained\r\n        in each section of these Terms and Conditions: (i) The nature of the Aeroplan Program; (ii) Enrollment in the Aeroplan Program; (iii) Online Access to your Aeroplan Membership Information and Account; (iv) Our Communications with You; (v) Keeping\r\n        your Aeroplan Membership Information Secure and Up-to-Date; (vi) Accumulation and Redemption of Aeroplan Points; (vii) Aeroplan Family Sharing; (viii) Account Inactivity; (ix) Termination of your Aeroplan Membership; (x) Welcome Bonus Provisions;\r\n        (xi) Prohibited Activity; (xii) No Property or Vested Rights; (xiii) Changes to these Terms and Conditions and the Aeroplan Program; (xiv) Additional Terms and Conditions of Aeroplan\u2019s Participating Partners and Suppliers; (xv) Adjustments and\r\n        Liability in case of Errors; (xvi) Limitation of Liability; (xvii) Taxes, Fees and other Charges; (xviii) Governing Law and Dispute Resolution; (xix) Aeroplan Privacy Policy; (xx) General Provisions; (xxi) Contact Information; and (xxii) Effective\r\n        Date. Aeroplan may from time to time, sponsor or provide time-limited promotions and offers relating to the Aeroplan Program. The provision of such promotions and offers do not constitute a change to these Terms and Conditions. Notification required\r\n        pursuant to these Terms and Conditions will be provided to you in accordance with applicable law and Section 4 of these Terms and Conditions. For Quebec residents, such notification will be provided between the 90th and 60th day before a change\r\n        comes into effect. The notification will set out the new clause, or the amended clause and how it read formerly, and the date on which the change will come into effect. Unless you expressly terminate your Aeroplan Membership upon a change to these\r\n        terms and conditions, your continued participation in the Aeroplan Program will constitute your consent to a change to these Terms and Conditions, as amended.<br><br></li>\r\n    <li><strong>13. Additional terms and conditions of Aeroplan's participating partners and suppliers</strong><br /> <br /> Aeroplan has a variety of participating partners and suppliers that permit the accumulation and redemption of Aeroplan Points in association\r\n        with their products and services. These participating partners and suppliers are independent entities and have their own additional terms and conditions and policies that apply to the accumulation and redemption of Aeroplan Points, which terms\r\n        and conditions you must accept in order to accumulate or redeem with them as applicable. Aeroplan is not responsible for the terms and conditions under which they provide for the accumulation of Aeroplan Points or for the nature or quality of\r\n        the products or services redeemed through them. <br /> <br /> Flight Reward redemptions are subject to those additional terms and conditions imposed by the airline that is providing the reservation and the air transportation services that are\r\n        provided pursuant to a Flight Reward are subject to each airline's tariffs, conditions of carriage, policies and international conventions and arrangements. Aeroplan does not own, manage, operate or control any airline, nor is Aeroplan responsible\r\n        for any airline activities relating to, and including, flight schedules, seat selection, baggage allowance and applicable fees, schedule changes, and flight cancellations or delays. For your convenience, the additional pricing and policies applicable\r\n        to Flight Rewards can be found\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.aircanada.com/ca/en/aco/home/aeroplan/redeem.html\">here</a>. <br /> <br /> Participating partners' and suppliers' terms and conditions (including for certainty, those of airline partners), may\r\n        change from time to time and without notice from Aeroplan. By way of example, participating partners and suppliers may, at their discretion, change the amount of Aeroplan Points required for redemption of their products and services or the number\r\n        of Aeroplan Points credited for a transaction, or impose other restrictions upon the use of their products and services. You should always verify directly with each partner or supplier to obtain their most current terms and conditions. <br />        <br /> In the unlikely event that an Aeroplan participating partner or supplier becomes insolvent, Aeroplan reserves the right to reverse any Aeroplan Points that were accumulated by you through that partner or supplier within the 30-day period\r\n        prior to the partner's or supplier's insolvency or anytime thereafter.<br><br></li>\r\n    <li><strong>14. Adjustments and liability in case of errors</strong><br /> <br /> Aeroplan reserves the right to make any adjustments and correct any errors, at any time and for any reason, with or without notice, including if Aeroplan Points have been\r\n        erroneously earned or credited to your Account or earned at an incorrect, higher earn rate. <br /> <br /> Aeroplan and each of its participating partners and suppliers, may also refuse Aeroplan rewards, reverse Aeroplan rewards already claimed,\r\n        or deduct additional Aeroplan Points from your Account where an error in the Aeroplan Points required for the reward existed at the time of reward claim. These rights will be applied whether that error occurred through an act or omission by Aeroplan\r\n        or one of its participating partners or suppliers.<br><br></li>\r\n    <li><strong>15. Limitation of liability</strong><br /> <br /> Aeroplan (including its affiliates and representatives) assumes no liability to you for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation, as a result of any change or termination to the\r\n        Aeroplan Program (including any changes or removal of participating partners and suppliers), any changes to accumulation or redemption requirements, or for any errors relating to your Aeroplan Membership or Account information. <br /> <br /> By\r\n        joining or participating in the Aeroplan Program, you (and your parent or legal guardian, as the case may be) agree to release and discharge Aeroplan, our affiliates and representatives, and each of our and their respective officers, directors,\r\n        agents, representatives, successors and assigns, from any loss, liability, claim, demand, damage or expense asserted by any person or entity including, without limitation, relating in any way to the Aeroplan Program, your participation in the\r\n        Aeroplan Program or the accumulation or redemption or use of any product or service obtained in connection with the Aeroplan Program. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, Aeroplan (including our affiliates and representatives) is not liable in any manner\r\n        for any tax consequences which result from your participation in the Aeroplan Program. You are solely responsible for the reporting of any income tax benefits and the payment of any taxes. <br /> <br /> In no event shall Aeroplan, including our\r\n        affiliates and representatives, and each of our and their respective officers, directors, agents, successors and assigns, be liable for any direct, indirect, punitive, incidental, special, economic, exemplary or consequential damages of any kind,\r\n        whether based in contract, tort or otherwise, which arise out of or are in any way connected with your Aeroplan Membership, the Aeroplan Program or these Terms and Conditions.<br><br></li>\r\n    <li><strong>16. Taxes, fees and other charges</strong><br /> <br /> You are responsible for all taxes, fees, charges (including but not limited to departure and security charges), surcharges and levies imposed by, or with, the authority of any government\r\n        or governmental authority, airport, airport authority, aviation authority, air carrier or airline (including but not limited to those in respect to any rewards or benefit) and any service fees imposed by Aeroplan.<br><br></li>\r\n    <li><strong>17. Governing law and dispute resolution</strong><br /> <br /> The Aeroplan Program, including these Terms and Conditions, is governed by the provincial laws of the province of Ontario and the federal laws applicable therein, without reference\r\n        to conflict of laws provisions. Any disputes relating in any way to these Terms and Conditions, the Aeroplan Program or Aeroplan Membership shall be submitted to the courts of the Province of Ontario which shall have exclusive jurisdiction over\r\n        such disputes. However, in respect of residents of the Province of Quebec, these Terms and Conditions are governed by the provincial laws of the Province of Quebec and the federal laws applicable therein. For certainty, enrollment in the Aeroplan\r\n        Program occurs in the Province of Ontario upon confirmation by Aeroplan to you of your Aeroplan Membership.<br><br></li>\r\n    <li><strong>18. Aeroplan Privacy Policy</strong><br /> <br /> Aeroplan takes your privacy seriously. The Aeroplan Privacy Policy (\"<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>\") describes how we collect, use and disclose your personal information (\"<strong>data</strong>\")\r\n        to deliver our program to you. Those data practices are integral to the Aeroplan Program value exchange. In return for your data, we maximize the value of your membership to you by offering personalized and relevant opportunities to earn and redeem\r\n        points. Accordingly, to participate in the Aeroplan Program, you must consent to the terms of the Privacy Policy which can be found <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.aircanada.com/aeroplan-privacypolicy\">here</a> and the collection, use and disclosure of your\r\n        personal information that it describes, as modified from time to time. This condition does not apply to members in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom and Switzerland, who must acknowledge the Privacy Policy as adapted.<br><br></li>\r\n    <li><strong>19. General</strong><br /> <br /> No waiver by Aeroplan of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. Each of the provisions contained in these Terms and Conditions is distinct\r\n        and severable and a declaration of invalidity or unenforceability of any such provision or part thereof by a court of competent jurisdiction will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of these Terms and Conditions.<br\r\n        /> <br /> Aeroplan reserves the right to sell, transfer or assign all or part of the Aeroplan Program to any third party. <br /> <br /> Aeroplan reserves the right to withdraw or temporarily change or suspend all or part of the Aeroplan Program\r\n        in any way, in the event of a material error, omission, technical problem, computer virus or bugs, tampering, unauthorized intervention, fraud, technical failure or any other cause beyond our reasonable control that interferes with the proper\r\n        conduct of any aspect of the Aeroplan Program as set out in these Terms and Conditions. Any attempt to deliberately damage or to undermine the legitimate operation of the Aeroplan Program in any way (as Aeroplan may determine in our sole discretion)\r\n        could be a violation of criminal or civil laws and should such an attempt be made, we reserve the right to seek remedies and damages to the fullest extent permitted by law.<br><br></li>\r\n    <li><strong>20. Contact information</strong><br /> <br /> If you have any questions about the Aeroplan Program, please go online at aircanada.com/aeroplan or call 1-800-361-5373.<br><br></li>\r\n    <li><strong>21.
